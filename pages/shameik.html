    <h2>Shameik Moore in Spider-Man</h2>
    <p>This is the first major animated Spider-Man movie. Instead of Peter Parker as Spider-Man, this movie features Mile Morales, voiced by Shameik Moore. This series has a very unique approach to Spider-Man and to the plot, a part of its success. This franchise has a multiverse concept, resulting in a variety of stars and antagonists.</p>
    <p>The heroine is Gwen Stacy voiced by Hailee Steinfield</p>
